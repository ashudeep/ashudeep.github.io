  [//]: # (<!-- I am an Applied Scientist at Pinterest Labs where I build machine learning algorithms for inclusive and diverse recommendations at scale. In 2021, I completed my PhD in Computer Science at Cornell University where I was advised by [Thorsten Joachims](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/){:target="\_blank"} along with [Solon Barocas](http://solon.barocas.org/), [Karthik Sridharan](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~sridharan/){:target="\_blank"}, and [David Mimno](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/){:target="\_blank"} on my dissertation committee. -->)

  **Areas of Interest**: Machine Learning, Responsible AI, Ranking & Recommender systems, Information Retrieval, AI Safety.

  I am an Applied Scientist at Pinterest Labs where I work on topics related to Responsible AI and ML fairness, ensuring that the AI and ML systems provide **utility to users** while also guaranteeing **fairness and safety to all stakeholders**.
  
 I completed my PhD in Computer Science at Cornell University in 2021 where I was advised by [Thorsten Joachims](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/){:target="\_blank"}. My PhD thesis focused on building machine learning models and algorithms to **learn from interactive user feedback** in user-facing platforms such as search and recommendation. I developed a notion of fairness in recommender and ranking systems to ensure fairness to users and creators/producers. 

  During my PhD, I was fortunate to have [Solon Barocas](http://solon.barocas.org/), [Karthik Sridharan](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~sridharan/){:target="\_blank"}, and [David Mimno](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/){:target="\_blank"} on my dissertation committee. I also completed internships at Google Brain, Facebook Research, and Microsoft Research (NYC and Montreal), where I had the opportunity to collaborate closely with [Alex Beutel](http://alexbeutel.com/), [Fernando Diaz](https://841.io/), [Khalid El-Arini](http://www.khalidelarini.com/), [John Langford](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jcl/). Previously, I was an undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur and also spent a summer doing NLP research at Carnegie Mellon University.

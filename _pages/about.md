 I ~~am a Ph.D. Candidate~~ recently completed my PhD in Computer Science at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY. I ~~am~~ was advised by [Thorsten Joachims](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/){:target="\_blank"} and fortunate to have [Solon Barocas](http://solon.barocas.org/), [Karthik Sridharan](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~sridharan/){:target="\_blank"}, and [David Mimno](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/){:target="\_blank"} on my dissertation committee. 

  My research spans the broad areas of Machine Learning, Recommender Systems, and Information Retrieval. My research focuses on:
  * Building machine learning models and algorithms to **learn from interactive user feedback** in user-facing platforms such as search and recommendation.
  * **Fairness and Responsibility** aspects of Recommender Systems considering fair distribution of opportunity for both users as well as the items. 
  
  Through my research, I envision search and recommendation systems to form the **foundation of economically sustainable multistakeholder online platforms** that ensure utility, fairness, and safety for the users as well as the creators and producers.

  During my Ph.D., I have completed internships at Google Brain, Facebook Research, and Microsoft Research (NYC and Montreal) where I had the opportunity to collaborate closely with [Alex Beutel](http://alexbeutel.com/), [Fernando Diaz](https://fernando.diaz.nyc/), [Khalid El-Arini](http://www.khalidelarini.com/), [John Langford](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jcl/). Previously, I was an undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur and also spent a summer at Carnegie Mellon University doing research on Natural Language Processing.

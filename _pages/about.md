  [//]: # (<!-- I am an Applied & Data Scientist at Microsoft where I build machine learning algorithms for search and recommender systems. My research interests lie in building ML algorithms that serve inclusive and diverse recommendations at scale. In 2021, I completed my PhD in Computer Science at Cornell University where I was advised by [Thorsten Joachims](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/){:target="\_blank"} along with [Solon Barocas](http://solon.barocas.org/), [Karthik Sridharan](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~sridharan/){:target="\_blank"}, and [David Mimno](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/){:target="\_blank"} on my dissertation committee. -->)

  **Areas of Interest**: Machine Learning, Responsible AI, Ranking & Recommender systems, Information Retrieval, AI Safety.
  
  I am an Applied Scientist at Microsoft AI, where I focus on applied research in search, recommendation, and other user interaction systems. My work emphasizes the development of practical multimodal deep neural networks that learn from human interactions and leverage LLMs, VLMs, and Generative AI. I am also passionate about Responsible AI, aiming to ensure fairness and safety for diverse user communities.

  Prior to joining Microsoft, I was an Applied Scientist at Pinterest Labs, specializing in Responsible AI and machine learning fairness. My work at Pinterest focused on developing AI and ML systems that balanced user value with fairness and safety for all stakeholders.
    
  I completed my PhD in Computer Science at Cornell University in 2021 where I was advised by [Thorsten Joachims](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/){:target="\_blank"}. My PhD thesis focused on building machine learning models and algorithms to **learn from interactive user feedback** in user-facing platforms such as search and recommendation. I developed a notion of fairness in recommender and ranking systems to ensure fairness to users and creators/producers. 

  During my PhD, I was fortunate to have [Solon Barocas](http://solon.barocas.org/), [Karthik Sridharan](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~sridharan/){:target="\_blank"}, and [David Mimno](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/){:target="\_blank"} on my dissertation committee. I also completed internships at Google Brain, Facebook Research, and Microsoft Research (NYC and Montreal), where I had the opportunity to collaborate closely with [Alex Beutel](http://alexbeutel.com/), [Fernando Diaz](https://841.io/), [Khalid El-Arini](http://www.khalidelarini.com/), [John Langford](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jcl/). Previously, I was an undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur and also spent a summer doing NLP research at Carnegie Mellon University.

Our recent work on [diversification in search and recommender systems](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3593013.3594112) across the Pinterest platform was accepted to [ACM FAccT 2023](https://facctconference.org/2023/). See you in Chicago! <br>

It was recently also published on the [Pinterest Engineering blog](https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/representation-online-matters-practical-end-to-end-diversification-in-search-and-recommender-cb60b547f2e0).
